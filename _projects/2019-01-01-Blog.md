This blog was made using the Jekyll Static Site Generator. By creating my own custom HTML theme, I was able to generate a simple blog with a home page, blog posts, and a recent posts widget in the sidebar.

I began considering this project with the intention of demonstrating some Jekyll concepts as a part of a presentation series we do at Maxx called Maxx Undiscovered. While gathering a list of project ideas, I thought about the primary purposes of Jekyll. One of Jekyll's main purposes is to make blogging easy, so why not make a blog?

Instead of spending too much time worrying about designing a UI for a project aimed almost explicitly at adding Jekyll's functionality to an existing webpage, I opted to find a template.
I found a simple and functional UI in a set of matching templates for a [blog home](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/blog-home/) page and [blog post](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/blog-post/) page from [startbootstrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com). This also demonstrated that those with little HTML experience can still find HTML templates and add Jekyll to them without having to build out their own site.

Now that I had a UI to work with, I still needed to find some content. In a similar manner to the UI, I didn't want the blog to get too caught up on the content. I wanted to show that with little time, you could take your existing content and create a beautiful blog. For this, I turned to Leo Babauta's [zen habits](https://zenhabits.net) blog. This simple blog is completely uncopyrighted and packed to the brim with great content. Leo's blog utilizes almost all text elements (ordered and unordered lists, blockquotes, bolds, italics, etc.) which also made it a great candidate to display different text elements.

Since Zen Habits does not feature any images, I searched google images for banner images that complemented the content.

Now on to the fun bits.

This blog features many different components of Jekyll. It uses layouts, includes, loops, and pagination.

When I have the time, I'll give a more formal write-up of how the site was created.
