A Javascript Clock inspired by Wes Bos's JavaScript30 challenge. One of the challenges was to create a clock using JavaScript. I decided to make my own rendition based on a quartz clock.

Featuring an animation upon load that spins all of the clock's tick marks into place on their own.

I created and published an accompanying blog article that explains how to create the clock yourself. I led a *MAXX Undiscovered* session at my job providing a live tutorial on how to create your own clock in this fashion and explaining some of the math behind the CSS in greater depth.

This project was hosted on CodePen instead of GitHub because it is a smaller project intended to be copied for others to create their own versions of. If you would like to view the demo, click `Preview`. If you would like to read the how-to blog post, click `View on Github`.
